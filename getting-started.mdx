# Getting Started

Welcome to Payvia! Follow these steps to get up and running quickly.

## Prerequisites

- A Payvia/Deets account (sign up via your platform or contact support)
- API key and App key (provided during onboarding)
- Node.js, Python, or your preferred language installed

---

## 1. Environment Setup

- Clone your docs or integration repo (see [Quickstart](/quickstart))
- Install required dependencies for your language (e.g., `axios` for Node.js, `requests` for Python)

---

## 2. Obtain API Credentials

- **API Key**: Provided by your account manager or in your dashboard
- **App Key**: Used for authentication
- **Merchant ID (MID)**: Where funds will be credited

> For sandbox testing, use the credentials provided in your dashboard or by your account manager.

---

## 3. Sandbox vs. Production

- **Sandbox**: Test your integration safely using sandbox endpoints and credentials
- **Production**: Go live with real transactions using production endpoints and credentials

> Always test thoroughly in sandbox before switching to production.

---

## 4. Make Your First API Call

Here's how to authenticate and get started (Node.js example):

```js
const axios = require('axios');

const response = await axios.post(
  'https://test.digitszapi.com/test/auth/token',
  {
    data: {
      type: 'auth',
      attributes: {
        appKey: 'YOUR_APP_KEY'
      }
    }
  },
  {
    headers: {
      'x-api-key': 'YOUR_API_KEY',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
  }
);

console.log('Token:', response.data.data.attributes.appToken);
```

> Replace `YOUR_APP_KEY` and `YOUR_API_KEY` with your sandbox credentials.
