# Welcome to Deets – Your Gateway to Secure Payments

Deets is your trusted partner for handling credit card payments securely while ensuring compliance with PCI DSS standards. With Deets, you can process transactions with confidence, leveraging powerful tokenization technology to keep sensitive data out of your infrastructure.

By integrating Deets, you can streamline your payment workflow in just two simple steps:

1. [Create a token](./create-a-token) using Deets iFrame.
2. [Create a payment](./create-a-payment) using Deets API with the token from Step 1.

## Step 1: Create a Token

To tokenize your client's payment data, you'll use Deets iFrame—a seamless and secure way to capture payment details without handling sensitive information directly. By embedding Deets iFrame into your application, you ensure that all credit card details remain encrypted and protected, significantly reducing your PCI compliance burden.

<Callout type="info" title="How it Works:">
- Your customer enters their payment details into the Deets iFrame.
- The iFrame transmits the data securely to our servers.
- Deets generates a unique, encrypted token and sends it back to your system.
</Callout>

With this token, you're ready to process the payment without ever handling raw card details! For integration guidance, visit [Create a Token](./create-a-token).

## Step 2: Process the Payment

Once you have the tokenized data, you can initiate payments seamlessly using Deets API. Our API empowers you to handle transactions efficiently, whether it's a one-time charge or a split payment where funds are distributed across multiple recipients.

### Payment Options
- **Regular Payment**: Process a standard charge with ease.
- **Split Payment**: Distribute funds dynamically, sending a portion directly to the platform.

For full API details and implementation steps, visit [Create a Payment](./create-a-payment).
