# Tokenization

Tokenization is a security process that replaces sensitive payment data (like credit card numbers) with unique, non-sensitive tokens. These tokens can be safely stored, transmitted, and used for payment processingâ€”without exposing the original card data.

---

## How Deets Uses Tokenization

- When a customer enters payment details, Deets iFrame captures and tokenizes the data instantly.
- The original card data is never stored or transmitted to your servers.
- A secure token is returned to your backend, which you use for payment processing, refunds, and recurring charges.

---

## Benefits of Tokenization

- **Reduces PCI scope:** No sensitive card data touches your infrastructure.
- **Prevents data breaches:** Stolen tokens are useless without Deets' systems.
- **Enables recurring payments:** Securely store and reuse tokens for subscriptions or one-click checkout.
- **Simplifies compliance:** Focus on your business, not on complex security requirements.

## Best Practices

- Always use the Deets iFrame to tokenize payment data.
- Never attempt to store or process raw card data yourself.
- Use tokens for all payment, refund, and recurring billing operations.
